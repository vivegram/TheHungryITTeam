## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- A Google Cloud project with the Google Sheets API enabled (for restaurant data and order saving)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vivegram/TheHungryITTeam.git
   cd TheHungryITTeam
   ```

2. **Configure Google API Integration**

   a. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable the Google Sheets API for your project:
     - In the left sidebar, click on "APIs & Services" > "Library"
     - Search for "Google Sheets API"
     - Click on it and then click "Enable"

   b. **Create API Credentials**:
   - In your Google Cloud project, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" and select "API Key"
   - A new API key will be created. Copy this key.
   - (Optional but recommended) Restrict the API key:
     - Click on the newly created API key
     - Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
     - Select "Google Sheets API" from the dropdown
     - Click "Save"

   c. **Create a Google Sheet**:
   - Create a new Google Sheet
   - Create a sheet named "Restaurants" with restaurant names in column A
   - Make sure the spreadsheet is publicly accessible:
     - Click "Share" in the top right corner
     - Click "Change to anyone with the link"
     - Make sure "Editor" is selected (this is required for saving orders)
     - Click "Done"
   - Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL (it's the long string between /d/ and /edit in the URL)
     - For example, in `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jyH_xabjV4b_5Kvuh-LYaRSXFkPBsPo3L15cy1WjjOI/edit`, the ID is `1jyH_xabjV4b_5Kvuh-LYaRSXFkPBsPo3L15cy1WjjOI`

   d. **Update the Configuration**:
   - Open the `restaurantLoader.js` and `orderSaver.js` files
   - Replace the values for `SPREADSHEET_ID` and `API_KEY` with your actual values in both files:
     ```javascript
     const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'your-spreadsheet-id';
     const API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
     ```

## üíª Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (through a local server)
2. The app will automatically load restaurants from Google Sheets
3. Select a restaurant from the dropdown
4. Enter your name, your order, and the price (optional)
5. Click the "Add Order" button to add your order to the list
6. The app will automatically calculate the total number of orders and total price
7. All orders are saved to Google Sheets and organized by restaurant and date

### Order Management

Orders are saved to Google Sheets for easy reference:

1. **Saving Orders to Google Sheets**:
   - When you add or delete an order, it's automatically saved to Google Sheets
   - A new sheet is created for each restaurant and date combination (e.g., "McDonald's_2025-02-27")
   - Each sheet includes columns for Name, Order, and Price
   - You can access these sheets directly in your Google Spreadsheet to view or export the data

2. **Order Organization**:
   - Orders are organized by restaurant and date
   - Each day's orders for a specific restaurant are stored in a separate sheet
   - This makes it easy to track orders over time and reference past orders

### Restaurant Management

Restaurants are loaded from Google Sheets:

1. **Restaurants from Google Sheets**:
   - Restaurants are loaded from the "Restaurants" sheet in your Google Sheet
   - If the Google Sheets API fails to load, default restaurants will be shown

2. **Select from Existing Restaurants**:
   - Choose from the dropdown list of restaurants
   - This includes both restaurants from Google Sheets and default fallback restaurants

### Favorite Orders

The app allows users to save and reuse their favorite orders:

1. **Saving a Favorite Order**:
   - Select a restaurant
   - Enter your name, order, and price
   - Click the "Save as Favorite" button
   - The order will be saved as your favorite for that restaurant

2. **Using a Favorite Order**:
   - Your saved favorites appear in the "Your Favorite Orders" section
   - Click on any favorite to automatically fill in the order form
   - If the restaurant doesn't match the currently selected one, you'll be asked if you want to switch
   - You can then click "Add Order" to add it to the current order list

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running Locally

You can run this app locally by opening the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. However, for the Google Sheets API to work properly, you'll need to:

1. Host the app on a web server (even locally):
   - You can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
     ```
     # Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Python 2
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
     ```
   - Or use Node.js with a package like `http-server`:
     ```
     # Install http-server globally
     npm install -g http-server
     
     # Run the server
     http-server -p 8000
     ```
   - Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

2. Configure your Google Cloud project:
   - Make sure the Google Sheets API is enabled
   - If you've restricted your API key to specific domains, add `localhost` to the list of authorized domains

3. Make sure your Google Sheet is publicly accessible:
   - Anyone with the link should be able to edit the sheet (required for saving orders)
   - The sheet should have a tab named "Restaurants" with restaurant names in column A

4. If you encounter any issues:
   - Check the browser console for error messages
   - Verify that your API key and spreadsheet ID are correct
   - Ensure that the Google Sheets API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
   - Make sure your spreadsheet is publicly accessible with edit permissions

### Customizing the App

You can easily customize this app for your team:

1. **Add More Default Restaurants**:
   - Edit the `restaurantLoader.js` file to add more default restaurants to the `defaultRestaurants` array

2. **Modify the Order Form**:
   - Add additional fields like special instructions or dietary preferences
   - Change the styling in the CSS file to match your company branding

3. **Add Features**:
   - Implement order sorting or filtering
   - Add a feature to export the day's orders as a PDF
   - Create a view for order history
